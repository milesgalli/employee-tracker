# Final Thoughts 

This application could be refractored and organised better.I could have used different files to house all the main functions. However this required having a high level understanding of async await and promises. I am imporving my understanding of promises, however this area needs some work. 

I need to improve my knowledge of table joins, as i found this to be particulary confusing. I did enjoy using a database as it demonstrated an important part of softare engineering. 

 Although this is the basic version of the assingment, if i had added on the bonus it would have been alot longer. Im becoming more confident in writing my own code, howver it is often small things that trip me up. I have a strong understanding of what to build and how to build it, but my execution needs work.
